Enter the PostgreSQL shell by running psql in your terminal. You can view the current dbs using the \l command. To create a new db by running the following SQL statement:

CREATE DATABASE top_users;
\l again to see if the db was created. 

To connect to the db:

\c top_users

Verify that the psql prompt should be:
top_users=#

Now create a table and its columns to store username data:

CREATE TABLE usernames (
   id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
   username VARCHAR ( 255 ) 
);

Verify that the table has been created by running \d. You should see the following two tables in the output (weâ€™ve skipped some output details for brevity):

use psql to create a table using following SQL
CREATE TABLE users (
   id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
   username VARCHAR ( 255 ),
   password VARCHAR ( 255 )
);
